## R CMD check results

0 errors | 1 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* The warnings are compiler warnings from upstream libraries.
* On Windows there are additional warnings for Makefiles with CR or CRLF line endings and containing GNU extensions. These Makefiles are generated by cmake for the given environment so they are not actually non-portable.
