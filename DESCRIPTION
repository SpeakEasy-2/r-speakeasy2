Description: A graph community detection algorithm that aims to be performant
    on large graphs and robust, returning consistent results across runs.
    Provides the 'SpeakEasy 2' (SE2) algorithm for use in R. The core algorithm
    is written in C, providing speed and keeping the memory requirments low.
    This implementation can take advantage of multiple computing cores without
    increasing memory usage. SE2 can detect community structure across scales,
    making it a good choice for biological data, which is often has hierchical
    structure. Graphs can be passed to the algorithm as adjacency matrices
    using the 'Matrix' library, 'igraph' graphs, or any data that can coreced
    into a matrix.
